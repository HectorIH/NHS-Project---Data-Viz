# Case NHS 

## Project Description 
In this project, I aim to analyze the data collected from NHS ( National Health Service ) in the United Kingdom.
In the past two years, NHS was deeply impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. In this project, I aim to demonstrate how NHS was impacted regarding Cancer cases, diagnosed and undiagnosed. Also, to show how image tests and operations were canceled and/or have been postponed.

## Steps 
* Collect data from the Government, NHS dataset, and API.
* Clean and prepare data for analysis
* Tableau was the Bi tool used in this project.

## Findings 

*	The NHS’s Cancer backlog increased by more than 30%
*	Cancer diagnosis decreased by more than 40% in the last 2 years ( 2020 and 2021)
*	6 weeks – the waiting list for image testing was 3 times greater than the average seen last decade.
*	Urgent and elective operations also doubled the number of cancelations.
